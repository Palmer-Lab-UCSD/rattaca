Description: The RATTACA method aims at predicting rat
    traits from low coverage sequencing measurements.
    Using these trait predictions, animals with predicted
    extreme phenotypes will be selected for study.  Here
    we provide helper tools for fitting a Linear
    Mixed Model (LMM) with the 'rrBLUP' package to
    data, assess the LMM performance under the
    stated goals of the RATTACA project, and scripts to
    integrate in bioinformatic pipelines.
