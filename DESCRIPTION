Description: The RATTACA method uses SNP genotypes produced from low-coverage 
    DNA sequencing to predict phenotypes in HS rats, then uses these trait 
    predictions to assign for study animals with predicted extreme phenotypes. 
    This package provides helper tools for fitting linear mixed models (LMM) 
    for prediction, and assessing LMM performance under the goals of the 
    RATTACA project.
