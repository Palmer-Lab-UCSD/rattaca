These data are a subset of data generated by Mika Okamoto and
copied from the following directories:

* ld_prune.{bim,bed,fam} 
    /projects/ps-palmer/bbjohnson/rattaca/ld_prune/pruned_data/round10_1000_100_0.99/ldprune
* test_pheno.csv consists of 3 columns copied from 
    /projects/ps-palmer/bbjohnson/rattaca/nida_poster/all_pheno_merged.csv 

I believe that the data subsetting was performed by
the included script `prepare_data.R`.
